== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How will I know if the changes are applied? =
You may want to download my other plugin called "userSwitcher". It allows you to see all changes from different type of user or user group.
And when you do so, do choose an specific user belonging to a group rather than a group. Selecting a group instead of user makes you the current user. So you might not see the difference.

= Will it change the core wordpress capabilities? =
Technically yes. It's what it is made for. But it will not change anything directly. It only changes the interface. If you decide to turn this plugin off, all settings will disappear as well. Your site will resume to it's original glory.

= Will it changes administrators capabilities? =
Oh yes provided that the administrator whom you want to have a different capabilities is/are not selected as controller. All selected controllers becomes the super-admin of your site. Any changes you made will not have any effect to you or your selected controllers.

= Will my selected controller can remove me as controller? =
Unfortunately yes. As controller he has the power to change the settings at the back. He can either remove or change your capabilities or make you a subscriber. Anything is possible.
